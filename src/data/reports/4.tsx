      <h2>Details of the Incident</h2>
      <p>According to notification letters filed with the Maine Attorney Generalâ€™s Office, the breach was discovered in early 2024 and was attributed to unauthorized access to systems that contained sensitive employee and HR records.</p>

        <li>Home addresses</li>

        <li>Health insurance and benefit enrollment details</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Firms in the construction and engineering sector should monitor for suspicious activity targeting HR and finance systems</li>
        <li>Ensure all personally identifiable information (PII) is encrypted at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Implement access logs and alerting around sensitive personnel data repositories</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>This incident highlights the growing interest of ransomware groups in targeting non-traditional sectors like construction where cybersecurity budgets may be lower, but data value remains high.</p>
