    content: `
      <p>In March 2025, the RansomHouse extortion group added <strong>Loretto Hospital</strong>, a nonprofit healthcare provider in Chicago, to its leak site, claiming responsibility for a cyberattack that allegedly resulted in the exfiltration of <strong>1.5 terabytes of data</strong>.</p>
  
      <p>Loretto Hospital offers medical and behavioral health services in the city’s Austin neighborhood and serves a predominantly underserved population. The group published evidence of the breach, including files purported to be hospital records and patient data, on its darknet portal.</p>
  
      <h2>What We Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>RansomHouse claims to have stolen administrative documents, employee data, and patient records.</li>
        <li>Samples posted include internal HR files and financial documents, although authenticity has not been independently verified.</li>
        <li>The hospital did not immediately confirm or deny the breach as of the initial reporting date.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>RansomHouse is known for double-extortion tactics: exfiltrating data before encrypting systems, then threatening public exposure. The group has previously targeted healthcare, education, and tech sectors.</p>
  
      <p>Healthcare providers continue to be disproportionately targeted by ransomware groups due to their operational sensitivity and the presence of protected health information (PHI), which is highly valuable on the black market.</p>
  
      <h2>Response & Implications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Loretto Hospital has not made a public statement as of early April 2025 regarding the incident.</li>
        <li>It is unclear whether ransomware was deployed or if the attack focused solely on data exfiltration.</li>
        <li>Regulatory bodies, including HHS and state authorities, may initiate investigations depending on the scope of the breach.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>The incident underscores the persistent targeting of regional medical providers and the need for proactive ransomware defense strategies, including segmentation, employee phishing training, and rapid incident response protocols.</p>
