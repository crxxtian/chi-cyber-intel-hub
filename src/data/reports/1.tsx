  content: `
    <p>In early March 2025, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) disclosed a significant data breach resulting from a cybersecurity incident involving a third-party vendor responsible for managing student information systems.</p>

    <h2>What Happened</h2>
    <p>The breach occurred when unauthorized access was gained to the vendorâ€™s cloud infrastructure. As a result, the personal data of more than <strong>700,000 current and former students</strong> was exposed. The data included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full names</li>
      <li>Dates of birth</li>
      <li>Student identification numbers</li>
      <li>Gender and enrollment status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How CPS Responded</h2>
    <p>Upon learning of the incident, CPS immediately began working with the vendor to assess the scope and impact. The district has since:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notified all affected families via email and postal mail</li>
      <li>Offered <strong>12 months of free identity monitoring</strong></li>
      <li>Engaged external forensic investigators and legal counsel</li>
      <li>Reported the incident to law enforcement and the Illinois Attorney General's Office</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <p>This breach raises concerns about third-party data security and the broader challenges educational institutions face in protecting sensitive student information. While no financial data or Social Security numbers were reportedly compromised, the scale of the breach is considered severe.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>CPS is now undergoing a full audit of its vendor ecosystem and implementing new guidelines for data handling and breach notification protocols. Affected individuals are encouraged to monitor their credit reports and take advantage of the identity protection services offered.</p>

    <p>Further updates will be shared by CPS and the Chicago Cyber Threat Intelligence Community as the investigation continues.</p>
